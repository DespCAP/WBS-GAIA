[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/926365662.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15733461)

This repository is the supplement to the paper titled "Detecting wide binaries using machine learning algorithms". [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19942](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19942)

The paper has been currently limited to the problem of WBS detection only, the second problem of detecting deviations is still a work in progress. 

The [notebooks](notebooks) folder contain the codes that can be used to replicate the results in the paper. The [wbs.ipynb](notebooks/wbs.ipynb) file is the main Jupyter notebook associated with the paper. 

The dataset is available on this Zenodo repository: https://zenodo.org/records/15729408
